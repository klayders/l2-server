# Algorithm for spawning phantoms:
# The wave of the spawn that triggers every 'waveRespawn' minutes, starts the algorithm,
# enumerating each spawn element given from spawn.xml and creates a task for the appearance
# random phantom, eligible criteria, In a given area and a predetermined amount.
# The delay for the task is specified by the config 'phantomSpawnDelayMinMax'.
# After the phantom spawn, a task is automatically created to remove the phantom, after the time specified 
# by the config 'phantomDespawnDelayMinMax'.
# 
# Algorithm of work AI:
# The phantom AI triggers every 'townAiTick'. During the tick (triggering ai), 
# randomize the execution of each action. Perform the first action, the chance of which has passed, or no, if no action is not pierced.
# It is important to note that changing the 'townAiTick' parameter will change the frequency of polling actions, which means changing
# Logical values of odds (for example, if the tick is reduced by a factor of 2, phantoms will perform actions 2 times
# More often with the same chances).
# Actions that require a delay before use are configured.
# For some delays, only one (minimum) value is configured. For such deleevs, the second value
# Is selected automatically.
# 
# Enchant algorithm:
# The algorithm goes through a value that starts with 'minEnchant' and increases by +1 with the chance given
# In the config 'enchantChance', until the chance fails, or we reach the maximum value of 'maxEnchant'.
